This is a simple flutter project to help track workouts as a part of a fitness challenge my friends and I are taking part in.

The app itself reads from, and writes to, a google spreadsheet we use to track how much of a particular workout a person has done.  This is accomplished throught a google apps script running as a web service.

It's a fun little side project I did to keep busy during coronavirus.  Stay safe and healthy!
